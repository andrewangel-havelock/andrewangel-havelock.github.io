Investigate file hosting options (e.g., OneDrive, Google Drive) or using Power Apps for data storage and retrieval.

2.  Barcode Scanner Functionality

Develop a feature to save scanned lists into a "truck load" format.

3.  Information Enhancement
Add extra information fields (e.g., "Jordy", "Motmusselops") to relevant data entries.
Include grade requirements in truck information.

4.  Data Analysis
Compare chiller counts to truck loads to ensure accuracy and identify discrepancies.
